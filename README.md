# India-state-guessing-game

This can be used as an educational app to help Indian middle school students check whether they remember the names of all the states of India
The game is played as follows:-
1. You will be given a blank state map of India
2. You will need to guess all the 30 states of India
3. Once you guess the name of the state correctly, the name appears on the state
4. If you cannot guess all the states correctly, the states that you could not guess is stored in a seperate .csv file
